		<p>  I'm from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I can speak 2 languages Vietnamese and English. I like playing video games, in fact, when I was a high-schooler, during the summerbreak, I used to sit in front of the screen for 8-12 hours a day, sometimes I even reached 14-6 hours. I still love playing games but now 3-4 hours of screen time is my highest.  </p>
	<h2> Interest in IT </h2>
		<ul>
		<li>The 2 aspect that I like the most about IT is game industry and smart house setup. I like playing video game since I was a middle-schooler but the interest in smart house is recent. I pick up that interest when I started to use the Amazon Echo smart AI, Alexa. I went on YouTube and saw how people modify their house with Alexa application. </li>
		<li> At first, I wanted to find a university that I am able to study in international environment because I know the important of English in the future of my life. Then, my teacher and parent told me that RMIT is the best for my sake but the one who brought me to the decision was my cousin, a RMIT graduate. </li>

		<p> I like this position because, well, of course high salary is the first thing that draw my attention. However, I started to like this not because of the wage but because of the benefit that employee will get like good healthcare and advice for future improvement. In addition, I got to work in the English environment. </p>
		<p> The job required experience in every familiar programming languages and platforms. Have experience in a pacific methodology. Furthermore, speaking in English is a must. However, I am a freshman so I am just qualified in one requirement, communicate in English. </p>
		<p> Firstly, to get this position, I need to finish my university and apply for the much easier job. Then, by using the jobs hopping strategy to move between few different other positions, I will be able to earn all the experience that they need. However, it just a plan for now, I may change it soon.  </P>
	<h2> Personal Profile </h2>
		<h4> Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test </h4>
			<p> The result say that I am ENTJ which is stand for Extroverted, iNtuitive, Thinking and Judging. Those mean that I am a natural born leader and my strong point is managing underling. When I finish the test and saw the result, I did not believe it at first because I thought I was an introvert. However, by reading the description, I noticed it actually fit me about 90% which mean everything is accurate except they say I am good with bad with listening but I am opposite of that. </p>
