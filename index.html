		<ul>
		<li> Fullname: Hoan Minh Khoi </li>
		<li> ID: s3822041 </li>
		<li> E-mail: s3822041@rmit.edu.vn </li>
		</ul>
		<p>  I'm from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I can speak 2 languages Vietnamese and English. I like playing video games, in fact, when I was a high-schooler, during the summerbreak, I used to sit in front of the screen for 8-12 hours a day, sometimes I even reached 14-6 hours. I still love playing games but now 3-4 hours of screen time is my highest.  </p>
	<h2> Interest in IT </h2>
		<ul>
		<li>The 2 aspect that I like the most about IT is game industry and smart house setup. I like playing video game since I was a middle-schooler but the interest in smart house is recent. I pick up that interest when I started to use the Amazon Echo smart AI, Alexa. I went on YouTube and saw how people modify their house with Alexa application. </li>
		<li> At first, I wanted to find a university that I am able to study in international environment because I know the important of English in the future of my life. Then, my teacher and parent told me that RMIT is the best for my sake but the one who brought me to the decision was my cousin, a RMIT graduate. </li>
		<li> I want to learn every skill in the IT major. Although I need to focus on my strong side but I want to know everything where so that I can apply for any job in the future, even the one that required fullstack </li>
		</ul>
	<h2> Ideal job </h2>

	  <p>	<a href="https://www.vietnamworks.com/hcmc-senior-fullstack-developer-2000-3000-1-1269015-jv/?source=searchResults&searchType=2&placement=1269115&sortBy=date"> https://www.vietnamworks.com/hcmc-senior-fullstack-developer-2000-3000-1-1269015-jv/?source=searchResults&searchType=2&placement=1269115&sortBy=date </a> </P>
		<p> I like this position because, well, of course high salary is the first thing that draw my attention. However, I started to like this not because of the wage but because of the benefit that employee will get like good healthcare and advice for future improvement. In addition, I got to work in the English environment. </p>
		<p> The job required experience in every familiar programming languages and platforms. Have experience in a pacific methodology. Furthermore, speaking in English is a must. However, I am a freshman so I am just qualified in one requirement, communicate in English. </p>
		<p> Firstly, to get this position, I need to finish my university and apply for the much easier job. Then, by using the jobs hopping strategy to move between few different other positions, I will be able to earn all the experience that they need. However, it just a plan for now, I may change it soon.  </P>
	<h2> Personal Profile </h2>
		<h4> Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test </h4>
			<p> The result say that I am ENTJ which is stand for Extroverted, iNtuitive, Thinking and Judging. Those mean that I am a natural born leader and my strong point is managing underling. When I finish the test and saw the result, I did not believe it at first because I thought I was an introvert. However, by reading the description, I noticed it actually fit me about 90% which mean everything is accurate except they say I am good with bad with listening but I am opposite of that. For working in team, I may raise my voice against messy teammate which has been happened several times in the past. </p>
		<h4> Learning type test </h4>
			<p> The result show that I am visual learning type which is true. It is easier for me to learning new thing by looking at them. Because of that, when working in a team, analyzing works are more appropriate for me. </p>
		<h4> Creative type test </h4>
			<p> I was said that my creative type is visionary. It mean that i will picture the results of the idea in my head during the thinking time. However, picturing about an unfinished idea is difficult, so i have to spend most of my time to think and imagine. </p>
	<h2> Project idea </h2>
		<p> My project of choice is building a smart mirror which function as a mirror and display show the daily news. In this project, we have to build a mirror which have a display attach behind it. To make it run smartly, we need to make use of the minicomputer like Raspberry Pi or Arduino. What is left now is programing the system so that it can display the time, daily news, weather of the day or the maps for our destination. Furthermore, we can play around with the idea and adding some optional features like touch screen, smart AI with voice control (Alexa, Google assistance or Siri) and multiple profiles for each family member so they can custom it by their own taste. </p>
		<p> It took averagely 30 minutes in the morning for a person to get ready for the day, and then to get the earliest news it took 30 minutes more, not only that we also have to do those activities in other time of the day. Imagine that we can emerge two of that together and we will save a lot of our time. By saving those time, we will not need to be rush in the morning commute anymore. For example, if everyone in the city own this mirror, the city life will be much slower than at the present. </p>
		<h5> Features: </h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Firstly, we can update with the daily information during our personal hygiene. We will find out everyday weather, and that with be really helpful for planning the day. If it is raining outside or will be rain, we would know that umbrella is needed. In addition, we can set it up to display the daily traffic news so that we may be informed that which road is crowed or even having accident. Speaking from my experience, I always forget to look at the news because of the lack of morning prepare time, and there are a few times it was showered by I did not bring any umbrella or raincoat, so I was soaking. By that, preparing for the day will be more practical and effective, we will have less time wasted on the crowed road or taking cover on the rainy day. </li>
				<li> The second feature is separated profile for each people. This mean that every user can customize the mirror to display different thing to fit their own taste. For example, dad want to get updated with sport news but mom prefer gossip, now there is different user function we can look at different thing. This feature may look familiar because we already use it in our personal computer. However, in computer every time we want to use as different users we need to log in, so for this device we can use the face id to scan for the user and it will log out after we leave the mirror for a minute </li>
				<li> Thirdly, there will be an advices and tips feature to help the users when they need. For example, if that day the owners want to find a calm and relaxing place, the mirror will suggest some places. With the AI assistant, such as Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri, asking questions is much more helpful. There will be more useful tips if we know a good question to ask. In addition, it can connect on with our smart house system, so it can give us about some house keeping advices. Everyone wants to keep their house as clean as possible but do not know where to begin, so the mirror may have some advice for that too. </li>
				<li> The last attractive feature is just for fun, it is the emotion tracker function. It will scan our facial structure to find out our emotion so that it will know if we are happy or not. After knowing our emotion, the AI will reply with the appropriate response. For example, if we come back with a sad face, it will show us cat video to cheer us up or if we are happy it will congratulate us to make us even happier. </li>
			</ul>
		<p> To make the prototype, it required a lot of materials and tools. First of all, we need to have a display similar to the computer screen for presenting all of the function. Another crucial part is mirror, we need to find a grass material which is good at reflecting and also let the light of the display pass through.  More importantly, to make it run the system, we need to have a mini computer such as Raspberry Pi or Arduino. Lastly, a programming platform of choice is required, it is needed for us to write the system and to make it run certainly </p>
		<p> So, to build this smart mirror prototype it required a lot of software programming and hardware building skills. First required skilled is programming which is used for creating the system and software applications. Secondly, we need to have hardware assembling skill to connect between different components and even have to build them. In addition, some wood-working, metal-working or 3D printing skills are probably needed to build the frame and components housing units. Finally, it is taking a lot of time and money to make a prototype of a product, so we need to be patient and devotion for the project. </p>
		<p> If this project is successful, it will save us some time in the future and bring along a lot of positive effect. Like it was mentioned above, we will save a lot of time during morning preparation because we now can be updated with earliest news during our personal hygiene. It contributed to help the city lives less rush and busy because the residents usually do not have enough time to do all the daily routine activities.  Furthermore, its impact is like smart AI speaker, in the beginning no want that it is not that important but if you think about it make the concept of smart house become easier to set up. What I mean of this is that it may not make a huge revolution but it definitely makes our lives a lot easier. </p>
